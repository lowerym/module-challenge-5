# Module Challenge #5

## Description
We built a workday scheduler using JavaScript and the DayJS jQuery library for this fifth challenge. We used the starter code as a basis and built the application from there. After making the layout and styles, I created several variables to store information, like the current date, time, and the save button. Then, I had to create variables that would save the information added to the local storage and a function that would keep the data so that the user wouldn't lose the info upon refreshing the page. Tied to that was a function that would add a class to each time entry based on the current time. For instance, if it were 11 am, the 9 am and 10 am entries would be greyed out, the 11 am entries would be red, and the future times would be green. Lastly, I created a function that would show an alert whenever a new appointment was added to the local storage based on the mockup provided.
